# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the n8n-mcp repository, which appears to be intended for integrating n8n (workflow automation tool) with MCP (Model Context Protocol). The project is currently in its initial state with no implementation yet.

## Current State

The repository is newly initialized with:
- A basic README.md file
- Git repository initialized on the main branch
- Claude settings allowing bash commands (find and ls)

## Development Notes

Since this is a blank project, when implementing features:

1. **Project Setup**: If creating a Node.js/TypeScript project (common for n8n integrations), ensure to:
   - Initialize with appropriate package.json
   - Set up TypeScript configuration if needed
   - Configure appropriate build and test scripts

2. **MCP Integration**: When implementing MCP server functionality:
   - Follow the MCP specification for server implementation
   - Ensure proper protocol handling for n8n integration

3. **n8n Integration**: When working with n8n:
   - Consider n8n's node structure and API requirements
   - Implement appropriate credentials and connection handling

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal - structure will need to be established based on project requirements.
